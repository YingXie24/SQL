# Task 2: Catching Fraud

The Financial Crime team in company X has noticed something odd happening over the last few days and have requested additional information to investigate. I am tasked to help in analysing data from customer's transactional records, to find out what exactly is wrong.

This task is divided into three sections:
* SQL query debugging
* Identifying users of specific transactional attributes
* Finding fraudsters

## SQL query debugging 
In this section, I am given an SQL query. I am required to explain describe the query means, whether the query will work, and explain why or why not.


### Information provided for the task
Two csv files were provided to me for analysis of the data:
1. facial_similarity_reports.csv: Reports of all Facial similarity checks
1. doc_reports.csv: Reports of all Document checks

The csv files can be found in the [csv](https://github.com/YingXie24/SQL/tree/master/1-DigitalBanking-DataAnalytics/1-ImprovingKYC/csv) directory.

### My task deliverables
1. A PDF [report](https://github.com/YingXie24/SQL/blob/master/1-DigitalBanking-DataAnalytics/1-ImprovingKYC/Task1-ImprovingKYC-github.pdf) outlining the root causes and solutions to the problem, as well as inconsistencies in the data;
1. An Excel calculation [spreadsheet](https://github.com/YingXie24/SQL/blob/master/1-DigitalBanking-DataAnalytics/1-ImprovingKYC/Supporting_materials.xlsx) to support the findings;
1. As SQL file containing queries used to parse and analyse the csv data.
