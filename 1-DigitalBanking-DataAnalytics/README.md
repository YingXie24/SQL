# Digital Banking Data Analytics

This project is a 1-week take-home task that forms part of my application as an operations manager at a top digital banking company in the UK. 
The goal of this home task is to generate great ideas and solve problems that the company's team has faced in the past.

To maintain confidentiality of the company, I will refer the company as X in the forthcoming text.

There are two independent tasks in this challenge: 
* [Improving KYC](https://github.com/YingXie24/SQL/tree/master/1-DigitalBanking-DataAnalytics/1-ImprovingKYC) 
* [Catching fraud](https://github.com/YingXie24/SQL/tree/master/1-DigitalBanking-DataAnalytics/2-CatchingFraud)

My submission for the tasks contains: 
1. A PDF report of my findings and solutions for Improving KYC
2. An Excel calculation file to support the material in Improving KYC
2. A PDF report for Catching Fraud

Detailed descriptions of the tasks can be found in the corresponding directory.
